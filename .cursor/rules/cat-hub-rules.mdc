- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines.
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.

- **React Query** - Data fetching
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

### General Rules

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or style tags.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names.
- Event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible.

### Accessibility

- Implement accessibility features on elements.
- For example, a clickable element should have:
  - `tabindex="0"`
  - `aria-label`
  - `onClick` handler
  - `onKeyDown` handler
  - Similar attributes as needed

### Dark Theme Design System

Always use the project's dark theme color system:

- **Background**: `#0D0D0D` (Ultra Dark)
- **Panels**: `#1A1A1A` (Dark Panel)
- **Cards**: `#111111` (Dark Card)
- **Primary**: `#1E90FF` (Blue)
- **Success**: `#00D084` (Green)
- **Danger**: `#FF4D4F` (Red)
- **Warning**: `#FADB14` (Yellow)
- **Info**: `#13C2C2` (Cyan)
- **Text Primary**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Text Secondary**: `#A6A6A6`
- **Borders**: `#2E2E2E`

### Project Structure

Follow the established project structure:

- Use `/app` directory structure (Next.js App Router)
- Place components in `/components` with proper categorization
- Use TypeScript types from `/types`
- Follow the established API patterns in `/app/api`
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
